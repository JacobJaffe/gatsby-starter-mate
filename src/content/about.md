Jumbo**Code** is an organization dedicated to helping non-profits by providing them free, custom, technology to aid their services. Jumbo**Code** is based out of Tufts University, and works primarily with non-profits in the greater Boston area. Jumbo**Code** was founded in 2015, and is 100% run by volunteers.

### Our Goals

We have two main goals encompassing our work:

1. To support local communities in social and civic endeavorments
2. To empower students with the technological skills to be impactful

### Our Process

Jumbo**Code** projects run throughout the academic school year. In the summer, we work with non-profits to gauge their needs, and workshop potential technological solutions. Well fitting projects are assigned a project lead, who then begins working more closely with their client to plan out their project. Near the end of the summer, project leads begin developing architecture bases for their code bases.

Teams of ~10 students, from a variety of development, design, and management backgrounds, are formed in September. These teams work closely with their clients to develop, deploy, test, and iterate on their projects during the next 9 months.

Projects typically start testing with clients in the begining of the Spring semester in mid Janurary, and hand off completely by the end of the academic year, in late April.
