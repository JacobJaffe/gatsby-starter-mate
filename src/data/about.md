JumboCode is an organization dedicated to helping non-profits by providing with them free, custom, technology in order to help them continue their great work. JumboCode is based out of Tufts University and works primarily (but not exclusively) with non-profits in the Greater Boston area. The club was founded in 2015 and is 100% run by student volunteers.

### Our Goals

There are two main goals that encompass our work:

1. To support local communities in social and civic endeavors
2. To empower students with the technological skills to be impactful

### Our Process

JumboCode projects run throughout the academic school year. In the summer, we work with non-profit organizations to gauge their needs and brainstorm potential technological solutions. Near the end of the summer, selected projects are assigned a project lead, who then begins working more closely with the respective non-profit to plan out the project. Shortly after that, project leads begin developing architecture bases for their code bases.

Teams of around 10 students from a variety of development, design, and management backgrounds are formed in September. These teams work with their respective non-profits to develop, deploy, test, and iterate on their projects over the next 9 months.

Projects typically start testing with clients in the begining of the Spring semester in mid-Janurary and are handed off completely by the end of the academic year in late April.
