JumboCode is an organization dedicated to helping non-profits by providing them free, custom, technology to aid their services. JumboCode is based out of Tufts University and works primarily with non-profits in the greater Boston area. The club was founded in 2015 and is 100% run by student volunteers.

### Our Goals

There are two main goals that encompass our work:

1. To support local communities in social and civic endeavorments
2. To empower students with the technological skills to be impactful

### Our Process

JumboCode projects run throughout the academic school year. In the summer, we work with non-profit organizations to gauge their needs, and brainstorm potential technological solutions. Well-fitting projects are assigned a project lead, who then begins working more closely with their client to plan out the project. Near the end of the summer, project leads begin developing architecture bases for their code bases.

Teams of around 10 students from a variety of development, design, and management backgrounds are formed in September. These teams work with their client non-profits to develop, deploy, test, and iterate on their projects over the next 9 months.

Projects typically start testing with clients in the begining of the Spring semester in mid-Janurary and are handed off completely by the end of the academic year in late April.
